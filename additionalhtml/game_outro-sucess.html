            <h1>Captain Errol to Commander Been</h1>
            <p>
              Congratulations, Commander Been! You really made it! So I now owe Captain Blackcutter 500 &#163;.
							That serves me right as I did not believe in Phileas Fogg, too. Anyway,
              I will come humble to your save return party.
            </p>
            <p>
							A little bit akward: We did not expect you back so soon, as you were an eternal distance away. Ahem ...
              What I want to say: We had no time to think about how to honor you for your invaluable service. I am sure, that the Queen
							wishes to give you knighthood, so we will surely meet at the Royal Barbeque for a small chitchat.
            </p>

            <p>
              Long live the Queen and the Empire!
            </p>
