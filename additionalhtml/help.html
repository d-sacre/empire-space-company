              <h1>Help: How to use the gui </h1>
                  The main userinterface is hidden per default. Only the headup-gui is visible
                  all the time. By clicking on the headup-gui or the top of the menu rocket visible at
                  the bottom of the screen, the game menu will slide up. To hide the settings, simply click
                  again. The clickable areas are marked in the picture below.

              <h1>Getting started</h1>
                  <h3>First steps </h3>
                      To achieve the game's task, you need to get a central mining tunnel
                      for the workers. Otherwise it is impossible to mine the resources. Take
                      a good look at the map and decide, where it is most rewarding to mine.
											Then open the game menu
											</br>
											</br>
											<img src="../pictures/mission-calypso_game-popup_screenshot_small.jpg" style="width:40vw;"></img>
											</br>
											</br>

											and select with the slider placed in the fieldset "main drill depth"
                      the desired drilling depth. Confirm your choice by clicking on the "Start main drill!" button.
                      The drill will start working; the progress will be displayed in the fieldset. In the same moment,
											a worker will be commissioned for mining. This worker can not be decomissioned for the rest of the
											game!
                      </br>
                      As soon as the first blocks are removed, the destination for the worker can be set by simply hiding
                      the menu and clicking on the desired block that should be removed. If your choice is not yet reachable
                      by a horizontal tunnel, don't worry, the miner will remove all blocks between himself and the destination.
                      </br>
                      If you feel the need, you can always go deeper if necessecary (up until you reach the main drill limit).

                  <h3>A short introduction to the resource system</h3>
											<p>
													The basic principle of the game is very simple: Everything consumes resources. The player's task is yet to minimize
													the consumption, but still being able to mine 15 t of copper ore and – if possible – refine it to copper ingots.
										  </p>

											<p>
													Your main constraints are:
													<ul>
															<li>
																	Keep the energy above 50 HU,
															</li>
															<li>
																	Keep the CO<sub>2</sub> below 8 %,
															</li>
													</ul>
													or the game is over. You can do so if you mine the minerals and refine them. The green Caloricum crystals
													can be processed to energy, the blue and gray pottasium ore can be turned into decarbonizers. Each used kilogram of
													Decarbonizers reduces the CO<sub>2</sub> by 2 %. You need to use it strategically: You only reduce CO<sub>2</sub>,
													but you do not regain O<sub>2</sub>! On the long run, you can not prevent the O<sub>2</sub> concentration
													to drop under 10.5 % which will also end the game. Treat the decarbonizers as a way to maintain productivity
													and not as a method to prolong the game drastically by all means. Strategic decisions are needed to win the game, not brute force!
											</p>


							<h3>Maschine speed, workers & productivity</h3>
									There are three main variables that determine your success: Maschine speed, worker asignement and productivity.
									<p>
											The machine speed acts as a multiplier. When set to zero, no operations are possible, but you do not consume any energy.
											The higher the value is set, the faster the main drill and the workers will move. Additionally, the refinery output is
											enlarged. The downside of setting a high machine speed: A lot more energy consumption and wear, which can be critical
											when it comes to the final take off.
									</p>

									<p>
											The amount of assigned workers can also multiply the output of operations. The downside of employing
											more workers: Energy & O<sub>2</sub> consumption will rise compared to idle state. Same applies for
											CO<sub>2</sub> production.
									</p>

									<p>
											The productivity massively determines the possible refinery production. It depends on
											<ul>
													<li>
																O<sub>2</sub> concentration,
													</li>
													<li>
																CO<sub>2</sub> concentration,
													</li>
													<li>
																machine speed.
													</li>
											</ul>
											Be aware that O<sub>2</sub> drops drastically during gameplay which definitely has a huge
											impact on your refinery output. Instead, the mining and main drill operations are not affect
											by productivity, so they keep their speed even at the end of the game.
									</p>

							<h3>Refinery</h3>
									<p>
										The refinery is a tool to extend your possible working time by generating new supplies as the
										initial storage won't last long.
									</p>

									<p>
										The refinery production and consumption depends on the following parameters:
										<ul>
												<li>
															machine speed,
												</li>
												<li>
															number of worker assigned to refinery,
												</li>
												<li>
															material multiplier (for weighting convertion priorities) ,
												</li>
												<li>
															productivity.
												</li>
										</ul>
										To use the refinery, simply check that the machine speed is non-zero, select the desired convertion priorities
										and assign some workers. The production will start automatically. Bear in mind that running the refinery will
										drastically rise your energy and oxygen consumption. So use this tool very carefully!
									</p>

							<h3>Fulfilling the task</h3>
									<p>
											If you have mined 15 t of copper ore, the task is automatically fulfilled. When the value is reached, a pop-up window
											will appear. You can continue the game for mining further resources, reliefing weight by converting
											raw resources into their refinery products or directly prepare the final take off.
									</p>

							<h3>Final take off</h3>
									When you decided to leave this desert planet, all ressource values will freeze and
									your engineer will calculate the probability for a successful take off. As parameters, he uses:
									<ul>
											<li>
														the available energy,
											</li>
											<li>
														the total weight,
											</li>
											<li>
														the wear of the rocket.
											</li>
									</ul>
									If the energy and the wear are too high, the rocket might explode. If you lack energy and are overloaded,
									the space ship might not overcome gravity and crash on the ground. So mine and work with foresight; all
									of your choices might have an impact!
